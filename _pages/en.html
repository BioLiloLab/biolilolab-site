titleAbout: BioLiloLab is a civil society association committed to biodiversity, education and conservation through art.
textAbout1: A culture medium is a preparation that contains all the substances necessary to intentionally grow microorganisms. Such practice reproduces in a Petri dish the conditions required by microorganisms' to live. In this sense, a culture medium lends itself to the description of BioLiloLab as a space that creates the necessary conditions for the development of research and experimentation in the intersection between art, design, and science.
textAbout2: The artists and scientists in this space prototype with biomaterials, develop artwork with science, provide scientific communication and promotion, offer curatorship in bioart, workshops, and talks. We are committed to raising knowledge about the Tropics' natural heritage.
